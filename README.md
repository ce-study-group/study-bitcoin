# Study Bitcoin

  This repo is an archive of materials used to study Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies' technology.

  Most university courses use [*Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Cryptocurrencies*](https://github.com/aantonop/bitcoinbook) and [Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies](https://d28rh4a8wq0iu5.cloudfront.net/bitcointech/readings/princeton_bitcoin_book.pdf) as references. We decided to choose the latter option.

  ## Courses
